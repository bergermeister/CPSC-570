CPSC-570 Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Project 2
BlockchainAES
This project implements a simple project which allows users to share data encrypted via
AES-256. Users exchange shared secrets via Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange across 2 or more
blocks in the chain. After this process, Users are able to use the shared secret to 
encrypt and decrypt data with trusted parties.

Running a node:
import Node
Node.Run( 'hostname', 5000 )

Node0, Node1, and Node2 can be run to host nodes on LocalHost at ports 5000, 5001, and
5002 respectively.

Each nodes hosts a web interface which can be interacted with via a web browser or an
application such as Postman.

Supported methods:
(GET) hostname:port/get_chain
(GET) hostname:port/is_valid
(GET) hostname:port/mine_block
(POST) hostname:port/add_transaction
	JSON Body:
	{
